this is a hash table implememnt
the hash table use single linked list resolve hash confilct
and it can synamic expansion when the elements number N is bigger than six times of bucket buckets M...
and the key is string(if you want store int->pointer key-value type , you can use intmap) and value is string too ...
and when the N is less than two times of M , the bucket will dynamic shrink ...
in expanding or shrinking , you can insert or delete the value too ...
In this way , you can insert / delete / find a key in O(1) time...

Wish you can enjoy it ...
